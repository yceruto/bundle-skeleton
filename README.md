# Symfony Bundle Skeleton

A streamlined Symfony bundle, highly recommended for creating new bundles, is equipped with [an assistant](https://github.com/yceruto/bundle-flex), 
which will help you configure the bundle according to your needs, while adhering to [Symfony Best Practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html).

## Installation

```bash
composer create-project yceruto/bundle-skeleton <your-bundle-name>
```

During the bundle installation process, you will be prompted to provide details about the features you wish to activate. 
Once this information is submitted, the assistant will handle the remaining setup for you.
