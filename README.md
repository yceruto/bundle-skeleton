# Symfony Bundle Skeleton

A minimal Symfony bundle recommended to create new bundles. It includes [an assistant](https://github.com/yceruto/bundle-flex) 
to help you create the basic structure of the new bundle following the [Symfony Best Practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html).

## Installation

```bash
composer create-project yceruto/bundle-skeleton <your-bundle-name>
```

During the bundle installation, you will be asked for some information regarding the features you want to enable, and the
assistant will do the rest.
