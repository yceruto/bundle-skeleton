# Symfony Bundle Skeleton

A streamlined Symfony bundle, ideal for creating new bundles, comes with a helpful [assistant](https://github.com/yceruto/bundle-flex). This assistant aids in 
configuring the bundle to suit your initial needs while ensuring compliance with [Symfony Best Practices](https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html).

## Installation

```bash
composer create-project yceruto/bundle-skeleton <your-bundle-name>
```

During the bundle installation process, you will be prompted to provide details about the features you wish to activate. 
Once this information is submitted, the assistant will handle the remaining setup for you.
